    <ul>
      <li>I’m interested in learning more about C/C# to create a Turn Based RPG in Unity3D.</li>
      <li>I’m learning C#, RMMV, and how to better my 3DS. I'm not as active in the first one, but I'm getting there.</li>
      <li>I have a potential collaboration project to start, but it's not ready to be put on Github just yet.</li>
      <li>To reach me, message me on Discord (wg481#2600) or find some way to at me.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What do you do?</h2>
    <p>Typically I'm on here to find 3DS homebrew, but I'm getting ready to start some projects in Github repo's.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What coding eperience do you have?</h2>
    <p>Very little GApps Script, amateur text-based Python, pretty good Scratch, absolutely garbage C#, great RPG Maker MV (RMMV), and I dabble a bit in Java. HTML is a given on this website, but is not mentioned in my README.md.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What are you working on?</h2>
    <p>Right now I have a project that is almost ready to be put on Github. It'll be completely open-source and ready for use by anyone.</p>
    <p>I began some modernization work on @nitrodragon's *Thundering Sky* project. Check out my fork <a href="https://github.com/wg481/ThunderingSky">here.</a></p>
